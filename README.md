# EnvyControl Applet for the Cinnamon Desktop

EnvyControl is a CLI tool that provides an easy way to switch between GPU modes on Nvidia Optimus systems (i.e laptops with hybrid Intel + Nvidia or AMD + Nvidia graphics configurations) under Linux. (see links below). All I'm hoping to do here is create an applet simular to the Linux Mint Nvidia-prime applet some already know to use Envycontrol rather than rely on the CLI to switch graphics.
